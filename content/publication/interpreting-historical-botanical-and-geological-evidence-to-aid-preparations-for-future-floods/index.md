abstract: River flooding is among the most destructive of natural hazards
  globally, causing widespread loss of life, damage to infrastructure and
  economic deprivation. Societies are currently under increasing threat from
  such floods, predominantly from increasing exposure of people and assets in
  flood‐prone areas, but also as a result of changes in flood magnitude,
  frequency, and timing. Accurate flood hazard and risk assessment are therefore
  crucial for the sustainable development of societies worldwide. With a paucity
  of hydrological measurements, evidence from the field offers the only insight
  into truly extreme events and their variability in space and time. Historical,
  botanical, and geological archives have increasingly been recognized as
  valuable sources of extreme flood event information. These different archives
  are here reviewed with a particular focus on the recording mechanisms of flood
  information, the historical development of the methodological approaches and
  the type of information that those archives can provide. These studies provide
  a wealthy dataset of hundreds of historical and palaeoflood series, whose
  analysis reveals a noticeable dominance of records in Europe. After describing
  the diversity of flood information provided by this dataset, we identify how
  these records have improved and could further improve flood hazard assessments
  and, thereby, flood management and mitigation plans.
