abstract: "Given its singular importance for water resources in the southwestern
  USA, the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) is remarkable for the paucity of
  its conventional hydrological record of extreme flooding. Short-term
  record-based flood frequency analyses lead to very great aleatory
  uncertainties about infrequent extreme flood events and their climate-driven
  causal associations. This study uses paleoflood hydrology to examine a small
  portion of the underutilized, but very extensive natural record of Holocene
  extreme floods in the UCRB. We perform a meta-analysis of 82 extreme
  paleofloods from 18 slack water deposit sites in the UCRB to show linkages
  between Holocene climate patterns and extreme floods. The analysis
  demonstrates several clusters of extreme flood activity: 8040–7960, 4400–4300,
  3600–3460, 2900–2740, 2390–1980, 1810–720, and 600–0 years BP. The extreme
  paleofloods were found to occur during both dry and wet periods in the
  paleoclimate record. When compared with independent paleoclimatic records
  across the Rocky Mountains and the southwestern USA, the observed temporal
  clustering pattern of UCRB extreme paleofloods shows associations with periods
  of abruptly intensified North Pacific-derived storms connected with enhanced
  variability of El Niño. This approach demonstrates the value of creating
  paleohydrological databases and comparing them with hydro-climatic proxies in
  order to identify natural patterns and to discover possible linkages to
  fundamental processes such as changes in climate."
