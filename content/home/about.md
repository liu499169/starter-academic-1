I am a research associate in the Department of Geosciences and Department of Hydrology and Atmosperic Sciences at the University of Arizona. My research interests are geohazards including floods on different scales, such as flash floods on hillslopes and megaflood on earth and Mars. I take a variety of analytical approaches to characterize the geohazards' distribution, mechanism, and risk assessment.
